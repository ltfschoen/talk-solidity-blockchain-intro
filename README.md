Some slides on Solidity as a blockchain programming language.

Built using http://remarkjs.com/ and http://rollupjs.org  
Hacked together with parts from https://github.com/consensys/contract-viewer

# Setup

- `npm install -g rollup`
- `npm install`

# Running

- `npm run build` & open `index.html` directly (bundled packages intentionally ommitted), or
- `npm run dev`

# Editing

Just hack at [`solidity-notes.md`](./solidity-notes.md) while viewing the dev server in your browser. `p` toggles presenter mode (so you can see the slide notes & TODOs).
