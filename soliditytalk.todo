Slide deck:
 ☐ get syntax highlighting for solidity working if possible:
    ☐ https://github.com/consensys/contract-viewer
    ☐ see if this fixes DAO what went wrong slide layout
 ☐ extract caveats & make clearer
 ☐ cite quotes
 ☐ maybe make suggestions into labels on other slides instead of takeovers
 ☐ go through todos, work out images & demo code needed:
   ☐ images:
     ☐ ....
   ☐ demo code:
     ☐ ....
 ☐ setup script for cloning libraries: get-example-libs.sh


Research:
 - Unit testing framework that outputs useful benchmarking data:
     - [confirm the following assumptions](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/q/5957/2665):
     - gas cost (indicator of computational complexity / electrical cost; estimated and actual)
     - memory & storage usage (indicator of long-term storage efficiency)
     - See if sol-unit / sunit is runnable and try to plug something in to it
 ☐ get dapple setup and see how unit testing operates
 - Benchmark various techniques to work out what's best
   At what rate does gas cost increase? In proportion to what?
   ☐ gas costs for storage manipulation: multiple mods vs single mod vs memory copy mod & replace
   ☐ gas costs for internal, external & library function calls
   ☐ gas costs for internal & external self / parent / ancestor / multiparent lookups
   - Understand inheritance: concatenative or delegative?
 - Test how fixed point rounding works
 - ABI encoders / decoders
 - ADTs along the lines of the C STL
 - Useful base classes
 - Design patterns
 - Interfacing with IPFS?

 ☐ Is it possible, or will it be possible, to bind Solidity types and contract source code to bytecode for debugging purposes, for external contracts someday? or now? can i hack mix?

 ☐ Can `bytes` be longer than 32?
   If so, all that stuff about 256 = 32 * 8 can go
